            <p>
                This team was born out of neccessity. The founders, Milad Gueramian (CS 16') and Jonathan
                Montesdeoca (EE '18') were driven by an undending passion for the sport and most importantly
                for USC. Absence of a competative men's soccer team such as an NCAA D1 program on campus was
                not viewed as an opportunity to innovate in the eyes of the founders, but rather as a lack in the integrity 
                of the university.
            </p>
            <p>
                Milad Gueramian started dabbling with the idea of creating a team back in 2013 before his
                first week of classes. Milad learned that there had been no students groups actively lobbying for this team
                so he started a
                <a href="https://www.change.org/p/c-l-max-nikias-start-an-ncaa-d1-men-s-soccer-team-at-usc">petition</a>
                to gauge student interest in an NCAA D1 men's soccer team. After very positive feedback Milad
                began looking for ways to bring the petition to the attention of administrators. Unfortunately,
                USC administration at several levels were not willing to hear what he had to say and they were
                deaf to the fact that 1,300+ students at the time were on board with the idea. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Luckily, in the Fall of 2015 Jonathan Montesdeoca found Milad's petition while independently
                searching for ways to bring soccer back to USC. The two joined forces and began concentrating
                their power into creative out of the box solutions. Years of research and collaboration led to the creation
                of this team and its accompanying student club.

        <div style="font-size: 20px; padding: 15px;">
            <p>
                Our club is a California registered 501(c)3 not for-profit organization. We are in our inagural season! The team will participate for the duration of the year in
                the <a href="http://socalpremier.org/_element_display/#%2F72238%2Fteams%2F88733119%2F89797375-88733208%2FTEAM.html%3Fdummy%3D1506809231896">SoCal Premier Leauge</a>. 
                This league is registered under the Cal South governing body which is a member of the 
                United States Adult Soccer Association. This means that we can participate in the 2018 edition of the
                <a href="https://www.ussoccer.com/lamar-hunt-us-open-cup">Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup</a> at the end of our season.
            </p>
            <p>
                The team competes in the bottom rung of SoCal Premier at the 3rd division. Competition is
                not stiff but our intent this first season is to focus on building our administrative team and
                familiarizing ourselves with the daily operations needed to sustain a full fledged soccer club in the future.
                We hope to finish the season strong still, by qualifying for the 2nd division and attracting more
                talented players. We rely on a mixture of donations and personal funds to operate, therefore, our first immediate
                challenge is to build a secure operating budget to fuel our operations smoothly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, we are working on developing and retaining the current talent at our disposal. USC has several students who played at top clubs in their home towns and even some who transfered from NCAA soccer programs. Our international pool of students is even more interesting. we realize that to build a strong program we need strong backers. We need to provide high intensity weekly training sessions, including strategy sessions with match video analysis in the classroom. We are looking for partners that can help us implement these plans.

        <div style="font-size: 20px; padding: 15px;">
            <p>
                Our ultimate goal is to have several teams, the first of which would be a well funded, USC backed,
                semi-professional team competeing in the <a href="http://www.uslpdl.com/">PDL</a>. Brigham
                Young University currently competes in the PDL and have been doing so for more than a decade.
                Their official men's soccer team therefore is competing outside of the NCAA. We want to utilize
                their model and improve and advance upon it, hopefully buying our own professional <a href="http://www.uslsoccer.com/">USL</a> franchise
                as well in the distant future. We want to be able to recruit players internationally and on
                scholarship (since we are outside of NCAA jurisdication we can have boosters too). We also want to
                give opportunities for community based players to participate in our club at all team levels. Our organization strives not only to bring competative
                mens soccer back to USC, but we hope to help bridge the gap between our community and the students at USC.
